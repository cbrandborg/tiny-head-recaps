Produce a script of The 4-Hour Workweek: Escape 9â€“5, Live Anywhere, and Join the New Rich, by Timothy Ferriss that encapsulates its key points over all its chapters and provides me with a summary ranging between 5000 to 8000 words.
Provide the explanation to me as if you were the content creator, Tiny Head, on Youtube that has read the book and summarizes its contents and make the tone light and casual. Start by welcoming the audience back to our channel and finish off by recommending the other videos if they haven't seen them. Additionally, provide remarks about what you especially liked and include a specific example that explains one or two key concepts from each chapter and apply them to a real life scenario. The output must be in SSML format and include breaks with <break> tags and use an X second pause after each paragraph and use an Y second pause after each sentence. Vary X between 1 and 2.5 seconds depending on the length of the paragraph that just ended. Vary Y between 0.3 and 1. Answer only with the Youtube script in SSML format as described previously and nothing else.
